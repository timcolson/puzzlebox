# PuzzleBox

Note to self on how to run this project which creates SVG files for a foldable box.

* Command is invoked with dimensions, but will default to a box 200 L x 150 W x 100 H.

* Use "air" to run the program whenever the code is updated and saved.

* Use "Gapplin" SVG viewer to view the output. Gapplin will automagically reload the updated SVG.
